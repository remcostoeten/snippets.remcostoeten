Welcome to **snippets.remcostoeten.com** — my personal collection of code, knowledge, and references.

This space is a living knowledge base where I share:

- ⚡ **React & Next.js snippets**
- 🧠 **Development thoughts**
- 📚 **Stored references** for daily work
- 🛠️ Best practices and patterns for building fast, scalable web apps

If you work with **Next.js**, **React 19**, **Drizzle ORM**, or care about SSR performance — you’ll probably find something useful here.
