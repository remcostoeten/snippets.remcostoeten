  As macOS itself already feels extremely sluggish and laggy compared to linux{" "}

  bearable.

This guide explains how to modify the `/etc/sudoers` file on macOS to disable password prompts when using `sudo`. This can streamline administrative tasks, but it's crucial to understand and mitigate the associated security risks.

### Steps to Disable Password Prompts for `sudo`

1.  **Open the `sudoers` file:**

    Use the `visudo` command to safely edit the `sudoers` file:

    ```bash
    sudo visudo
    ```

## Locate the admin group line

    Find the line that defines the permissions for the `admin` group. It typically looks like this:

    ```
    %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
    ```

## Modify the line to disable password prompts

    Replace the line with the following to allow members of the `admin` group to run `sudo` commands without a password:

    ```
    %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```

4.  **Save and exit:**

    Save the changes in `visudo`. and test a sudo command to ensure it works.
