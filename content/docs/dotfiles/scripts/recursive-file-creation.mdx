ToDo:

Instead of having to type
```bash
mkdir -p some/folder/that/doesnt/exist
&&
touch some/folder/that/doesnt/exist/some-file.sh 
&&
chmod +x some/folder/that/doesnt/exist/some-file.sh
```
You simply want to be able to do `mkdir` recursive instead of `mkdir -p` or `touch` recursive without having to create the directory first.
