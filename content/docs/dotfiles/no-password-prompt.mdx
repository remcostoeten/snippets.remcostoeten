Not really best practice but gets annoying fam.

Edit `visudo` by typing

```bash
sudo visudo
```
Yes, really just that. Not prefixed with `nvim` or so.

Almost at the bottom of the page you'll see a line which says:
```bash
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Simply change to:
```bash
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Et voil√†!
