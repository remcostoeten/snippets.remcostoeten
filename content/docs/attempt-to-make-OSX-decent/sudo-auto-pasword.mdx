guide explains how to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file on macOS to disable
password prompts when using `sudo`. This is useful for streamlining
administrative tasks but should be used cautiously due to security
implications.

## Installation

Use this command to safely edit the sudoers file.

#### CLI

`bash sudo visudo `

#### GUI

### Steps to Configure Passwordless `sudo`

```bash
# Open the sudoers file using visudo

sudo visudo

# Locate the following line:

%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Replace it with:

%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Save and exit
```

### Explanation of Changes

- `%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`: This line allows all users in the
  `admin` group (macOS's default admin group) to run `sudo` commands without
  being prompted for a password.

- `visudo`: The `visudo` command ensures syntax validation of the
  sudoers file, preventing accidental misconfigurations that could lock you out
  of administrative access.

## Testing

```bash

# Run any sudo command to verify

sudo ls /var/root

# Expected Result:

# The command should execute without prompting for a password.

```
