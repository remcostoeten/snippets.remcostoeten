If you clone, and get the question of `merge` /`rebase` or else, when your copy is different, and you don't feel like figuring out the history simply do:

```shell
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

This will delete the branch locally.

If you want to delete the branch from the remote, you can do:

```shell
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```
