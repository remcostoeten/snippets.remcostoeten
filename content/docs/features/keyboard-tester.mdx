title: "Keyboard Tester Feature Prompt"
language: "TypeScript"
description: "Build a Keyboard Tester Component in a Next.js App Router app that mimics a VIA-style interface, designed for user interaction and input visualization. No storage in localStorage or PostgreSQL is required, but a toggleable settings system should be implemented (can use URL params, Zustand, or context)."

### 🎹 Key Press Audio Feedback

- On each key press, **play a sound effect**
  - Notes ascend from left to right like a piano (A = lower tone, L = higher tone)
  - Add variation for modifiers (Enter, Shift, etc.)
- Should be **toggleable** via settings panel
- Use `AudioContext` for smooth playback

---

### 📖 Key Press History

- Collapsible panel that shows **latest 5 or 10** key presses
- Options:
  - Off (no history at all)
  - Show last 5
  - Show last 10
- History only registers **on key release**
  - Holding a key does not flood the list
- Each item in history:
  - Displays the key, keyCode, and timestamp

---

### 🎛️ Visual Keyboard Overlay

- Show a **full visual keyboard layout**

  - Based on US QWERTY (for now)
  - Support for laptop layout & external keyboards

- Two **visualization modes** (toggleable):

  1. **Sticky Mode**
     - Keys remain visually "pressed" after interaction
     - A "Reset" button clears the state
  2. **Animated Mode**
     - Keys animate down on press and fade out on release
     - Holding a key animates press but doesn't add to history

- Special handling:
  - Modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, etc.) should also be represented
  - Spacebar, Backspace, Tab, and arrow keys too

---

### ⚙️ Settings Panel

- Toggle controls:
  - ✅ Key sound feedback
  - ✅ Sticky or animated key press behavior
  - ✅ History panel mode: Off / Last 5 / Last 10
  - 🎯 Future-proofing: Layout (QWERTY / ISO / Mac)

---

### ♿ Accessibility & UX

- Works on physical keyboards, not just on-screen
- Keyboard-only users can navigate history/settings
- Visually impaired users can:
  - Rely on audio feedback
  - Enable sticky mode for clarity
- Mobile support not required

---

### 🧱 Internal State (No DB Required)

```ts
type KeyPress = {
  key: string;
  keyCode: number;
  timestamp: string;
};

type KeyboardTesterSettings = {
  enableSound: boolean;
  visualMode: "sticky" | "animated";
  historyLimit: 0 | 5 | 10;
};
```

---

### Example State in Memory

```ts
const history: KeyPress[] = [
  { key: "A", keyCode: 65, timestamp: "2025-04-13T17:11:32.551Z" },
  { key: "S", keyCode: 83, timestamp: "2025-04-13T17:11:33.011Z" },
];

const settings: KeyboardTesterSettings = {
  enableSound: true,
  visualMode: "animated",
  historyLimit: 5,
};
```

---

### 🧠 Implementation Notes

- Use `keydown`, `keyup`, and `keypress` events wisely:
  - `keydown` for animating press
  - `keyup` for history + visual reset (unless in sticky mode)
- `Set<string>` can help track currently held keys
- Optionally preload audio clips or use `AudioBufferSourceNode`
- A `<canvas>` or `<div>`-based grid can be used for the visual layout
