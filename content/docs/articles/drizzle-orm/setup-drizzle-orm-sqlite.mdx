This guide shows you how to configure `drizzle.config.ts` with SQLite with the newest version of Drizzle ORM.

First of all make sure you have the proper dependencies installed.

## Setting up the packages

```bash
pnpm install drizzle-orm
pnpm install drizzle-kit -D
```

Then you need to install the SQLite driver. There are two options. Either `libSQL` which can connect to both local SQLite and turso rremote databases. `betterr-sqlite3`. is for local SQLite only. I prefer the first one as we will show how to use turso later on.

```bash
pnpm install @libsql/client
```

<small>or `pnpm install better-sqlite3`</small>

## Setting the config

Now we need to create the main config file which is a file that points towards our client, schemas and so forth. In the root of your project run

```bash
touch drizzle.config.ts
```

This file consists of a `defineConfig` function that takes an object as an argument. It should always look like this as a minimum. There are morre advanced options, but likely you won't need them, or look up the official docs.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({});
```

In here we define ther location of our client (db connection), the schema path, the migration path and the dialect (language of the database).

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  out: "./src/server/db/migrations",
  schema: "./src/server/db/schema/index.ts",
  dialect: "sqlite",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```

The paths can be any you want, `out` will be generrated, `schema` and `client` must exist. I prefer to have these files. Typically you want to validate enviorment variables with zod, or a custom implementation which you can find in the guide I wrote here [here](/snippets/databases/validate-env-variables).ÃŸ

## The enviorment variables

For local SQLite we only need a url. This is defined in your `.env` file.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

It must be prefiex w ith `file:` as per SQLite convention. `./dev.db` is a file in the root of the project. Other common names are `./dev.sqlite`. I prefer to store it next to my other database files thus i'd opt for `DATABASE_URL=file:./src/server/db/database.db`

## Creating the schema

I will show you the most basic version. I perrsonally tend to use a way more comprehensive implementation which is way more modular and is heavy on seperration of concerns. Read more about it in the [guide](/snippets/nextjs-snippets/databases/drizzle-orm/modular-scalable-schema-design).

Then we can create tables. This is a example of a userrs table.

```ts
import { sqliteTable as table } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";
import * as t from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = table(
  "users",
  {
    id: t.int().primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
    firstName: t.text("first_name"),
    lastName: t.text("last_name"),
    email: t.text().notNull(),
    role: t.text().$type<"guest" | "user" | "admin">().default("guest"),
  },
  (table) => [t.uniqueIndex("email_idx").on(table.email)]
);
```

## Creating the client

Now we need to create the client that will be used to connect to the database.

```bash
touch src/server/db/index.ts
```

I always make a alias in my `tsconfig.json` file which will allow us to use the database like this: `import { db } from 'db'`. I do the same for the schema allowing us to use it like this: `import { users } from 'schema'`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...other compiler options,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "db": ["./src/server/db/index.ts"],
      "schema": ["./src/server/db/schema/index.ts"]
    }
  }
  }
}
```

This is all that's needed to populate the database with our schema. You should be able to run the following command to create the database and the tables.

```bash
pnpm dlx drizzle-kit generate
pnpm dlx drizzle-kit push
## or npx drizzle-kit generate
## or npx drizzle-kit push
```

And a database file should have spawned, which if inspected via a sqlite client will show the tables we just created.

Now you can query and mutate the database via server functions or api routes.

## Remote turso
