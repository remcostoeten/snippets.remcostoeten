This will show you how to design your schema for Drizzle ORM in a modular, scalable and maintainable way. Often you see a single file with a bunch of tables and a migration file. This is not scalable and is hard to maintain.

I am a fan of strrong seperration of concerns and single principles which means we have a single file for each table, expectations to some degree.

## The schema file

In our `drizzle.config.ts` we have a `schema` property which points to a file. This is the file that will be our main schema file. In this file we will NOT define the tables. We will only import them.

```bash
touch src/server/db/schema/index.ts
```
