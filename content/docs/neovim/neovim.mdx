```bash
ggVG
"_d
"+p
```

###  Explanation
`gg` to go to start of the file.
`VG` To select all below (entire file as you're at start because of `gg`.
`"_d` `_` prevents d from overwriting clipboard. `d` deletes the selection. Why `"` is needed, no clue.
`"+p` to paste clipboard. Maybe only `p` might work.
