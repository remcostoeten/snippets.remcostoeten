## Find and Replace in Neovim

### Basic command:

```vim
:%s/old_string/new_string/gc
```

### Explanation

- `:%s` - command to substitute in the entire file.
- `old_string` - the text you want to find.
- `new_string` - the text you want to replace with.
- `g` - global flag to replace all occurrences in each line.
- `c` - confirm flag to ask for confirmation before each replacement.

### Without confirmation

You can omit the 'c' if you want to replace all without confirmation:

```vim
:%s/old_string/new_string/g
```

### Visual selection

To replace only in a selected visual block, select text in visual mode and then use:

```vim
:'<,'>s/old_string/new_string/gc
```
