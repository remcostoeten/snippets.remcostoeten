### Context 7

This is a handy MCP server that is a community driven collection of almost all the docs you'd need for development. Which means no more cutting edge api hallucinations

To install in warp terminal

```json
{
  "Context7": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
    "env": {},
    "working_directory": null,
    "start_on_launch": true
  }
}
 ```
