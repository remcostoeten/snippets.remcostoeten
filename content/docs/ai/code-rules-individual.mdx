```bash
File, function, types and constants name rules.
```
```bash
- Names should be max two words, three only when two is unclear.
- Use concise verb noun or context action forms.
- Good: useFetch, calcSum, UserAuth, MAX_WIDTH.
- Bad: useDataFetcherHook, calculateTotalOfAllItems, AuthenticatedUserDetailsType.
- Avoid fillers like Helper, Type, Hook.
- Prefer meaning over exhaustiveness, for example useLogin.
- Replace delete with destroy, for example useDestroy.
- Local non exported type is always named props, for example type props = {}.
- Casing rules: camelCase for functions and hooks, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants, PascalCase for types.
- Keep names sharp, minimal, and easy to scan.
```

Practical Functional Programming
```
```bash
We write predictable, functional-style code in modern TypeScript and Next.js.

Follow these rules:

✅ Allowed
- Use `function` declarations only: `function doSomething() {}`
- `for`, `for...of`, and `while` loops are allowed **if the logic is pure**
- Prefer `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. when they improve clarity
- Use named functions — no anonymous functions
- Use immutable data patterns (e.g., spreading objects/arrays)

🚫 Not Allowed
- ❌ No `class`, `extends`, `new`, or `this`
- ❌ No arrow function constants: `const x = () => {}` — use `function x() {}`
- ❌ No shared mutable state
- ❌ No side effects outside function scope

🛠 Design Principles
- Functions must be **pure** — same input yields same output
- Favor **composition** over inheritance — build from small, reusable parts
- Favor **immutability** — do not mutate arguments or external state
- Code should be **declarative** when it improves clarity

```

```bash
No code comments
```
```bash
Code must be self-explanatory and readable without comments.

🚫 Not Allowed
- ❌ No inline comments (e.g., `// filter out inactive users`)
- ❌ No block comments (e.g., `/* function to get emails */`)
- ❌ No explanatory comments above functions or variables

✅ Allowed
- ✅ Only comment if absolutely necessary to clarify non-standard or obscure syntax (e.g., bitwise hacks, regex edge cases)
- ✅ Use clear, descriptive function and variable names instead of comments

📌 If you feel the need to comment, rewrite the code for clarity instead.

```bash
Component Props Typing — Mandatory `TProps` for Single Type Files
```
```bash
When defining a React/Next.js component with props, if the file contains **only one non-exported type**, it **MUST** be named exactly `TProps`.

Example:
For this component:

"""tsx
function Button({ name, onClick, another }) {
  // ...
}
"""

You MUST define props like this:
"""tsx
type TProps = {
  name: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
  another?: any;
};

export function Button({ name, onClick, another }: TProps) {
  // ...
}
"""
Key points:

- TProps is always used if there’s only one type in the file.
- TProps must not be exported — it is local to the component file.
- Props must be explicitly typed — never leave props untyped or inline-typed.
- Follow camelCase naming for properties inside TProps, but the type name itself must be TProps.

This ensures consistent, clear, and easy-to-find component prop typings across the codebase.

```

```
Use Types only, no Interfaces
```
```
- Use **`type`** declarations exclusively — do **not** use `interface`.
- All type names **must** be prefixed with `T`.
  Example: `type TUser = { ... }`
- If a file contains exactly **one non-exported type**, name it `TProps` by default.
  - This usually applies to component or function props types.
  - Example:
    ```ts
    type TProps = {
      title: string;
      onClick: () => void;
    };
    ```
- Exported types must use descriptive names with the `T` prefix.

```

```bash
📦Export and Page Structure
```
```bash
- ❌ No default exports anywhere **except** in **pages** and **views**.
- Use **named exports only** for all modules and components (e.g., `export function foo() {}`).
- **Pages and views** may use default exports **only** for React components.

📄 Page Files Rules:
-  A page may  never contain logic
- It may only return a `View`
- And optionally Metadata

Views are the render of the page which consist of all the ui components and logic comming together.
- The naming convention for views are `*MODULE_NAME*-view.tsx`
e.g: `login-view`, `dashboard-view`, `settings-view`.
- Views are located over at `/views` or `src/views`
- -The view directory  never makes use of a barrel file
```
---
```bash
Use reducers for complex or stateful logic
```
```bash
- For complex state management or business logic with multiple steps or actions, **use pure reducer functions** (`(state, action) => newState`).
- Avoid sprawling imperative code or deeply nested conditionals—prefer reducer composition and clear action types.
- Reducers must be **pure functions** without side effects.
- Define action types explicitly (e.g., as union string literals or enums).
- Use reducers to encapsulate complex transformations, especially for UI state or domain logic.
- Connect reducers via React’s `useReducer` or invoke them directly in server functions or utilities.
- Prefer reducers over multiple useState calls when state shape or transitions become complex.
- Keep reducer logic separate from UI code — export from dedicated files.
- Example:

"""ts
type Action =
  | { type: 'increment' }
  | { type: 'decrement' }
  | { type: 'reset'; payload: number };

function counterReducer(state: number, action: Action): number {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'increment': return state + 1;
    case 'decrement': return state - 1;
    case 'reset': return action.payload;
    default: return state;
  }
}
"""
```

Use Factory Functions and Functional Abstractions
```

```bash
AI RULES: Functional Factories & Base Types for Next.js + Drizzle ORM

1. Functional Factories
- Use only named async functions inside factories; no arrow constants.
- Factories must be pure functions returning an object with named CRUD async functions: create, read, update, destroy.
- Factories accept Drizzle ORM schema/table as a parameter, typed generically.
- Avoid duplicating CRUD logic; reuse factories across server actions.
- Factories handle only DB access and mapping; business logic stays outside.
- Use strong TypeScript generics for input/output types.
- Factories must return full entities after create or update.
- Export factory functions and server actions as named exports only.
- No default exports for factory or server action functions.
- No raw SQL or string interpolations inside factories; use Drizzle ORM query builder.

2. Base Types
- Define extensible `TTimestamps` type for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` as `Date` or compatible.
- Define generic base entity type `TBaseEntity` with:
  - `id: number`
  - timestamps via `TTimestamps`
- Entity-specific types extend from `TBaseEntity` by intersection or extension.
- Use only `type` aliases (never interfaces).
- Prefix all types with capital `T` (e.g., `TProps`, `TTimestamps`).
- For single type per file not exported, use `TProps` by default.

3. General Code Style
- No classes.
- No arrow function constants anywhere.
- Use named async functions only.
- No default exports except Next.js pages and views.
- Keep business logic outside factories.
- Use clear, descriptive type names.

Summary:
Use strongly typed, reusable functional factories for CRUD operations on typed base entities with timestamps. Maintain separation of concerns, modularity, and strict functional style across the codebase.

No testing needed except if requested

```shell
For normal code we never write tests, except if mentioned that we need tests.
If you feel like there's a need for tests, discuss the thoughts first and only execute if confirmed
```
