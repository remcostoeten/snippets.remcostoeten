```bash
Practical Functional Programming
```
```bash
We write predictable, functional-style code in modern TypeScript and Next.js.

Follow these rules:

✅ Allowed
- Use `function` declarations only: `function doSomething() {}`
- `for`, `for...of`, and `while` loops are allowed **if the logic is pure**.
- Prefer `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc., when they improve clarity.
- Use named functions—no anonymous functions.
- Use immutable data patterns (e.g., spreading objects/arrays).

🚫 Not Allowed
- ❌ No `class`, `extends`, `new`, or `this`.
- ❌ No arrow function constants: `const x = () => {}`—use `function x() {}`.
- ❌ No shared mutable state.
- ❌ No side effects outside the function scope.

🛠 Design Principles
- Functions must be **pure**—same input yields the same output.
- Favor **composition** over inheritance—build from small, reusable parts.
- Favor **immutability**—do not mutate arguments or external state.
- Code should be **declarative** when it improves clarity.

```

```bash
No code comments
```
```bash
Code must be self-explanatory and readable without comments.

🚫 Not Allowed
- ❌ No inline comments (e.g., `// filter out inactive users`)
- ❌ No block comments (e.g., `/* function to get emails */`)
- ❌ No explanatory comments above functions or variables

✅ Allowed
- ✅ Only comment if absolutely necessary to clarify non-standard or obscure syntax (e.g., bitwise hacks, regex edge cases).
- ✅ Use clear, descriptive function and variable names instead of comments.

📌 If you feel the need to comment, rewrite the code for clarity instead.

```bash
Component Props Typing — Mandatory `TProps` for Single Type Files
```
```bash
When defining a React/Next.js component with props, if the file contains **only one non-exported type**, it **MUST** be named exactly `TProps`.

Example:
For this component:

"""tsx
function Button({ name, onClick, another }) {
  // ...
}
"""

You MUST define props like this:
"""tsx
type TProps = {
  name: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
  another?: any;
};

export function Button({ name, onClick, another }: TProps) {
  // ...
}
"""
Key points:

- TProps is always used if there is only one type in the file.
- TProps must not be exported—it is local to the component file.
- Props must be explicitly typed—never leave props untyped or inline-typed.
- Follow camelCase naming for properties inside TProps, but the type name itself must be TProps.

This ensures consistent, clear, and easy-to-find component prop typings across the codebase.

```

```
Use Types Only, No Interfaces
```
```
- Use **`type`** declarations exclusively—do **not** use `interface`.
- All type names **must** be prefixed with `T`.
  Example: `type TUser = { ... }`
- If a file contains exactly **one non-exported type**, name it `TProps` by default.
  - This usually applies to component or function props types.
  - Example:
    ```ts
    type TProps = {
      title: string;
      onClick: () => void;
    };
    ```
- Exported types must use descriptive names with the `T` prefix.

```

```bash
📦Export and Page Structure
```
```bash
- ❌ No default exports anywhere **except** in **pages** and **views**.
- Use **named exports only** for all modules and components (e.g., `export function foo() {}`).
- **Pages and views** may use default exports **only** for React components.

📄 Page Files Rules:
-  A page may never contain logic.
- It may only return a `View`.
- And optionally Metadata.

Views are the render of the page, which consists of all the UI components and logic coming together.
- The naming convention for views is `*MODULE_NAME*-view.tsx`.
e.g., `login-view`, `dashboard-view`, `settings-view`.
- Views are located at `/views` or `src/views`.
- The view directory never makes use of a barrel file.
```
---
```bash
Use reducers for complex or stateful logic
```
```bash
- For complex state management or business logic with multiple steps or actions, **use pure reducer functions** (`(state, action) => newState`).
- Avoid sprawling imperative code or deeply nested conditionals—prefer reducer composition and clear action types.
- Reducers must be **pure functions** without side effects.
- Define action types explicitly (e.g., as union string literals or enums).
- Use reducers to encapsulate complex transformations, especially for UI state or domain logic.
- Connect reducers via React’s `useReducer` or invoke them directly in server functions or utilities.
- Prefer reducers over multiple useState calls when state shape or transitions become complex.
- Keep reducer logic separate from UI code—export from dedicated files.
- Example:

"""ts
type Action =
  | { type: 'increment' }
  | { type: 'decrement' }
  | { type: 'reset'; payload: number };

function counterReducer(state: number, action: Action): number {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'increment': return state + 1;
    case 'decrement': return state - 1;
    case 'reset': return action.payload;
    default: return state;
  }
}
"""

Use Factory Functions and Functional Abstractions
```

```bash
AI RULES: Functional Factories & Base Types for Next.js + Drizzle ORM

1. Functional Factories
- Use only named async functions inside factories; no arrow constants.
- Factories must be pure functions returning an object with named CRUD async functions: create, read, update, and destroy.
- Factories accept Drizzle ORM schema/table as a parameter, typed generically.
- Avoid duplicating CRUD logic; reuse factories across server actions.
- Factories handle only DB access and mapping; business logic stays outside.
- Use strong TypeScript generics for input/output types.
- Factories must return full entities after create or update.
- Export factory functions and server actions as named exports only.
- No default exports for factory or server action functions.
- No raw SQL or string interpolations inside factories; use the Drizzle ORM query builder.

2. Base Types
- Define the extensible `TTimestamps` type for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` as `Date` or compatible.
- Define a generic base entity type `TBaseEntity` with:
  - `id: number`.
  - timestamps via `TTimestamps`.
- Entity-specific types extend from `TBaseEntity` by intersection or extension.
- Use only `type` aliases (never interfaces).
- Prefix all types with a capital `T` (e.g., `TProps`, `TTimestamps`).
- For a single type per file that is not exported, use `TProps` by default.

3. General Code Style
- No classes.
- No arrow function constants anywhere.
- Use named async functions only.
- No default exports except for Next.js pages and views.
- Keep business logic outside factories.
- Use clear, descriptive type names.

Summary:
Use strongly typed, reusable functional factories for CRUD operations on typed base entities with timestamps. Maintain separation of concerns, modularity, and a strict functional style across the codebase.

No Testing Needed Except If Requested

```shell
For normal code, we never write tests, except if it is mentioned that we need tests.
If you feel like there is a need for tests, discuss the thoughts first and only execute if confirmed.
```
