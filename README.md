## Snippets.remcostoeten v2

This is a site containing various snippets, guides, personal reminders, and other boilerplates I often need to accessâ€”whether it be my shell configuration, some obscure low-level command that I need to run on new systems, or just simply a reminder for myself on how to set up self-rolled authentication, store certain queries I tent to use in PostgreSQL/SQLite or how to implement package X or program Y.

This is the v2 which is a React(19) + NextJS(15+) SSG generated site fully managed through `.mdx` files built on top of the [Fumadocs framework](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/) which ships out of the box  with features like MDX on steroids, ToC generation, site-wide search, allround good aesthetics and DX and way more.

The V1 was built on top of  [Nextra](https://nextra.site) which also was a static site generator, but after two years I felt re-thinking my overrwhelming amount of docs which I  never use anymore.
