# Snippets.remcostoeten - Legacy

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This is the legacy v1 branch** ⚠️

This is the v1 initial version which I've used for years to store my nonsense. Because of this, we have to run some dinosaur commands from pre-BC.

If, for some reason, you want to get up and running locally with this legacy version, make sure you're on the legacy branch `git checkout legacy` and simply run `npm run start`.

Or, if you don't trust my beautiful shell script, run:

```bash
npm install --force
npm run dev
```

## New Snippets

For easy creation of new snippets, `run npm run new:mdx`.
