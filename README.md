## Snippets.remcostoeten v2

This site contains snippets, guides, personal reminders, and boilerplates I often need. I use it to quickly access shell configurations, obscure commands, or reminders on setting up authentication. It also stores commonly used queries for PostgreSQL/SQLite and implementation details for various packages and programs.

This is version 2, built with React 19 and Next.js 15+ using Static Site Generation (SSG). It's fully managed through `.mdx` files and built on the [Fumadocs framework](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/). Fumadocs provides enhanced MDX support, automatic ToC generation, site-wide search, and excellent aesthetics and DX.

Version 1 was built on [Nextra](https://nextra.site), another static site generator. After two years, I decided to rethink my documentation, which I rarely used anymore.

xxx yours sincerely,

Remco Stoeten
